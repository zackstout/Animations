# Animations
A collection of animation scripts I've written to illustrate some cool mathematical ideas.

## Animations
- Cardioid (Multiplication Tables)
<!-- [al]('google.com') -->
    - Thanks to [Mathologer]('www..youtube.com/watch?v=qhbuKbxJsk8') for inspiring this animation.
    - [Github Repo]('www.github.com/zackstout/Cardioid-animation')
- Mandelbrot Set
    - Thanks to [Progur!]('progur.com/2017/02/create-mandelbrot-fractal-javascript.html') for inspiring this image.
- Golden Ratio
- Game of Life
    - Not quite operational yet.
- Sierpinski Triangle
    - Thanks to my friend [Aaron]('www.github.com/bozeman42') for enlightening me about this wonderful algorithm!

## Stretch Goals
- add Pong and sockets for player-to-player interaction
- let user drag vertices of Triangle
- let user change input on power of Mandlebrot set function
- let user zoom in on Mandelbrot set
- add user input for timing (and stop/start/rewind) on the cardioid
- let user alter speed and length-change factor of the flower
