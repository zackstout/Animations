# Animations
A collection of animation scripts I've written to illustrate some cool mathematical ideas.

## Animations
- Cardioid (Multiplication Tables)
- Mandelbrot Set
- Golden Ratio
- Game of Life
- Sierpinski Triangle

## Stretch Goals
- add Pong and sockets for player-to-player interaction
- let user drag vertices of Triangle
- let user change input on power of Mandlebrot set function
- let user zoom in on Mandelbrot set
- add user input for timing (and stop/start/rewind) on the cardioid
- let user alter speed and length-change factor of the flower
